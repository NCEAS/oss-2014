The RStudio server you used today has the following packages. While most are on CRAN and can be installed with `install.packages("package_name")`, several are in active development on GitHub and require installation directly from the source. For this, you'll need to use the `devtools` package and the following function:

```R
library(devtools)
install_github("github_account/repo_name")
```
