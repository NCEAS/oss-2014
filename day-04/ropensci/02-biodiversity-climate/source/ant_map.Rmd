## `AntWeb` : Mapping ant occurrence data

In this example we plot actual occurrence data for *Bradypus* species against a single predictor variable, `BIO1` (annual mean temperature). This is only ont step in a species distribution modelling nworkflow.

This example can be done using BISON data as well with our `rbison` package.

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  comment = "#>",
  error = FALSE,
  message = FALSE,
  warning = FALSE,
  tidy = FALSE
)
```



```{r load, comment = NA, cache = TRUE, results = "hide"}
library(AntWeb)
leaf_cutter_ants  <- aw_data(genus = "acromyrmex")
```

Then we can map these as an interactive map that is easy to embed on web pages, talks, etc.

```{r map, results = "hide", eval = FALSE}
aw_map(leaf_cutter_ants)
```
