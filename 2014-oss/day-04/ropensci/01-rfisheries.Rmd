# Fisheries landings example

First you'll need to install a few packages if you don't already have them


```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages(c("plyr", "ggplot2", "rfisheries"))
```

```{r, eval = TRUE}
# Next load up the package
library(rfisheries)
library(plyr) # for manipulating the data
library(ggplot2) # for visualizing the data
```

You start off by downloading a complete list of species from the FAO database

```{r species_codes}
species_list <- of_species_codes()
```

```{r species_list}
head(species_list)
```


Now you've got a list of `r nrow(species_list)` commerically valuable species. Let's write a small function to search for species by their common names

```{r fish_search}
fish_search <- function(query = NULL, species_list) {
	if(!is.null(query)) {
		species_list[grep(query, species_list$english_name), ]
	}
}
```

We'll create another function to fail gracefully if data are not available for a particular species or country.


```{r safe_landings}
Sys.setlocale('LC_ALL','C') 
safe_landings <- failwith(NULL, of_landings)
# failwith is a function in the plyr package.
```

Now let's search for all the lamprey species

```{r}
fish_search("lamprey", species_list)
```
or perhaps the cod species

```{r}
cods <- fish_search(" cod$", species_list)
# The $ means that cod should be the end of the name. 
# This avoids grabbing crocodiles for example.
cods
```

Now let's get data for these species

```{r}
cod_data <- ldply(cods$a3_code, function(x) {
	 safe_landings(species = x)
})
```


This will only retrieve data if avaialble for the few species that we subset from the larger list. We can plot these out:

```{r, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4}
ggplot(cod_data, aes(year, catch, color = species)) + geom_line(size = 1.1)
```

Now we can do the same for countries as well.

```{r}
country_list <- of_country_codes()
# Grabs a list of countries and their respective country codes
head(country_list)
```


Want landings data for USA?

```{r usa_catch, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4}
usa_data <- of_landings(country = "USA")
fish_plot(usa_data)
```

We can do some interesting comparisons of species. Let's examine the Anchovy fisheries in the Northern and Southern hemispheres (California versus Peru) and a couple of other commercially interesting fish species

```{r}
anchovies <- fish_search("anchovy", species_list)
head(anchovies)
```

```{r}
# Let's grab the two interesting anchovy fisheries (California and Peru) along with Cod and Tuna.
who <- c("TUX", "COD", "VET", "NPA")
dat <- ldply(who, function(x) safe_landings(species = x))
```

We can plot these data out:

```{r fisheries_collapse, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4}
ggplot(dat, aes(year, catch)) + geom_line() + 
facet_wrap(~species, scales = "free_y") 
```
