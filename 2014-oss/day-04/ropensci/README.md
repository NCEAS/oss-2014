# The rOpenSci project

The rOpenSci project aims to support reproducible, transparent, and data-driven science in various domains but particularly in the EEB community. In this lecture/demo combination, I'll provide an overview of the project in lecture form but combined with various hands on activities that you can run during the session.

For the hands on activities, please use our RStudio server (since there won't be time for me to make sure everyone has the latest version of all packages).  The server is available at [http://rstudio.ropensci.org](http://rstudio.ropensci.org). I'll provide logins for everyone.  More information about logins are on the [wiki.](https://github.com/NCEAS/training/wiki/rOpenSci-logins)
