* generally went well.
* bigpicture
    * message box: provide on-line tools for entering results?  (probably not. flip charts are fine.)

    * M Schildauer wants to know, can we discuss Bayes/frequentist? (probably not)
* lab: too long.  Split into main section (linear regression 3 ways) and keep randomization/permutation test stuff as "auxiliary" material?
