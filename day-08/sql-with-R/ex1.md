1. Using the iris dataset, collapse the measured variables into two columns, one with the identifier and one with the value. Once you're finished, the result should look like this:

```
  Species  leaf_attribute measurement
1  setosa Sepal.Length         5.1
2  setosa Sepal.Length         4.9
3  setosa Sepal.Length         4.7
4  setosa Sepal.Length         4.6
5  setosa Sepal.Length         5.0
6  setosa Sepal.Length         5.4
```

2. Load the `chicks.csv` file also located in this folder (see: [http://karthik.github.io/useR2014/#data_dryad](http://karthik.github.io/useR2014/#data_dryad) for how I downloaded that file). How would you reshape this file? Please discuss with a neighbor and post a solution.
