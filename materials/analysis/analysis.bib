	abstract = {This paper studies summary measures of the predictive power of a generalized linear model, paying special attention to a generalization of the multiple correlation coefficient from ordinary linear regression. The population value is the correlation between the response and its conditional expectation given the predictors, and the sample value is the correlation between the observed response and the model predicted value. We compare four estimators of the measure in terms of bias, mean squared error and behaviour in the presence of overparameterization. The sample estimator and a jack-knife estimator usually behave adequately, but a cross-validation estimator has a large negative bias with large mean squared error. One can use bootstrap methods to construct confidence intervals for the population value of the correlation measure and to estimate the degree to which a model selection procedure may provide an overly optimistic measure of the actual predictive power.

In this article we take a few steps in the direction of establishing such a foundation. Our approach is based on graphical perception-the visual decoding of information encoded on graphs-and it includes both theory and experimentation to test the theory. The theory deals with a small but important piece of the whole process of graphical perception. The first part is an identification of a set of elementary perceptual tasks that are carried out when people extract quantitative information from graphs. The second part is an ordering of the tasks on the basis of how accurately people perform them. Elements of the theory are tested by experimentation in which subjects record their judgments of the quantitative information on graphs. The experiments validate these elements but also suggest that the set of elementary tasks should be expanded. The theory provides a guideline for graph construction: Graphs should employ elementary tasks as high in the ordering as possible. This principle is applied to a variety of graphs, including bar charts, divided bar charts, pie charts, and statistical maps with shading. The conclusion is that radical surgery on these popular graphs is needed, and as replacements we offer alternative graphical forms-dot charts, dot charts with grouping, and framed-rectangle charts.},

But statistical graphics still occupy an awkward in-between position: within statistics, exploratory and graphical methods represent a minor subfield and are not well integrated with larger themes of modeling and inference. Outside of statistics, infographics (also called information visualization or Infovis) are huge, but their purveyors and enthusiasts appear largely to be uninterested in statistical principles. We present here a set of goals for graphical displays discussed primarily from the statistical point of view and discuss some inherent contradictions in these goals that may be impeding communication between the fields of statistics and Infovis. One of our constructive suggestions, to Infovis practitioners and statisticians alike, is to try not to cram into a single graph what can be better displayed in two or more. We recognize that we offer only one perspective and intend this article to be a starting point for a wide-ranging discussion among graphic designers, statisticians, and users of statistical methods. The purpose of this article is not to criticize but to explore the different goals that lead researchers in different fields to value different aspects of data visualization.},

In two localities, sympatric Anolis species with differential occurrences in sun or shade sought lower, more shaded perches during midday, resulting in partly nonsynchronous utilization of the vegetation by the two species. The second observation may be related to the first in the following way: nonsynchronous spatial overlap could dictate relatively great resource overlap for species coinhabiting patchy or edge areas, requiring great differences between the species in prey size in addition to those in climatic habitat. The extent of such overlap on small depauperate islands could be greater if these contained a greater proportion of patchy or edge habitats (with respect to insolation), or if climatic preferences were broader and more overlapping than on large, species-rich islands. In each locality, the relatively more shade-inhabiting species occurred more often on larger perches and on lower perches than did the other species. In both species of the Bermudan pair, adult males occupied higher and larger perches, and in grahami, shadier perches, than did female-sized individuals. The statistical significance of these and other differences was evaluated using several unweighted @g{\textasciicircum}2 procedures, Cochran's weighted @g{\textasciicircum}2 test and a partitioning technique for analyzing interactions among variables in complex contingency tables. The last method is described in detail in the papaer by Fienberg, immediately following this one.},

	processes that underlie
	
	hatchling production in the green turtle nesting population at Tortuguero,
	Costa Rica, and estimated
	
	current mean hatchling output and potential carrying capacity of Tortuguero
	beach for hatchlings
	
	and nesting females. Density-dependent effects of nest destruction
	by nesting females and coatis
	
	were evaluated in the 2000 nesting season along the 28.8 km nesting
	beach. To quantify factors
	
	affecting hatchling production, the fates of nests were monitored
	in twelve 50 m long study plots.
	
	Density-dependent factors included nest destruction by nesting females
	and predation by coatis,
	
	whereas density-independent factors included beach erosion, beach
	flooding, and below-beach-
	
	surface destruction by crabs, ants, microbes, and plant roots. Calculations
	indicated that between 5
	
	and 6 million hatchlings are currently produced, while a simulation
	model suggested that at carrying
	
	capacity, 6 to 10 times as many hatchlings could be produced by more
	than 600 000 nesting females.
	
	The current mean number of females nesting at Tortuguero is between
	3 and 4% of the population
	
	that is estimated to nest at carrying capacity. This estimate is consistent
	with previous estimates that
	
	modern day populations of Caribbean green turtles represent only 3
	to 7% of pre-exploitation levels.
	
	The hatchling production model is applicable to other beaches and
	sea turtle species, and provides a
	
	framework to evaluate recovery goals for sea turtles.},

	abstract = {1. Linear regression models are an important statistical tool in evolutionary and ecological studies. Unfortunately, these models often yield some uninterpretable estimates and hypothesis tests, especially when models contain interactions or polynomial terms. Furthermore, the standard errors for treatment groups, although often of interest for including in a publication, are not directly available in a standard linear model. 2. Centring and standardization of input variables are simple means to improve the interpretability of regression coefficients. Further, refitting the model with a slightly modified model structure allows extracting the appropriate standard errors for treatment groups directly from the model. 3. Centring will make main effects biologically interpretable even when involved in interactions and thus avoids the potential misinterpretation of main effects. This also applies to the estimation of linear effects in the presence of polynomials. Categorical input variables can also be centred and this sometimes assists interpretation. 4. Standardization (z-transformation) of input variables results in the estimation of standardized slopes or standardized partial regression coefficients. Standardized slopes are comparable in magnitude within models as well as between studies. They have some advantages over partial correlation coefficients and are often the more interesting standardized effect size. 5. The thoughtful removal of intercepts or main effects allows extracting treatment means or treatment slopes and their appropriate standard errors directly from a linear model. This provides a simple alternative to the more complicated calculation of standard errors from contrasts and main effects. 6. The simple methods presented here put the focus on parameter estimation (point estimates as well as confidence intervals) rather than on significance thresholds. They allow fitting complex, but meaningful models that can be concisely presented and interpreted. The presented methods can also be applied to generalised linear models {(GLM)} and linear mixed models.},

	abstract = {{"During} the past decade there has been an explosion in computation and information technology. With it have come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics."--Jacket.},

	abstract = {The majority of our understanding of mutualisms comes from studies of pairwise interactions. However, many hosts support mutualist guilds, and interactions among mutualists make the prediction of aggregate effects difficult. Here, we apply a factorial experiment to interactions of ‘guard’ crustaceans that defend their coral host from seastar predators. Predation was reduced by the presence of mutualists (15\% reduction in predation frequency and 45\% in volume of coral consumed). The frequency of attacks with both mutualists was lower than with a single species, but it did not differ significantly from the expected frequency of independent effects. In contrast, the combined defensive efficacy of both mutualist species reduced the volume of coral tissue lost by 73\%, significantly more than the 38\% reduction expected from independent defensive efforts, suggesting the existence of a cooperative synergy in defensive behaviors of ‘guard’ crustaceans. These emergent ‘multiple defender effects’ are statistically and ecologically analogous to the emergent concept of ‘multiple predator effects’ known from the predation literature.},

	abstract = {Tolerance to apical meristem damage {(AMD)} is a form of plant defense against herbivory. Theoretical models come to different conclusions about the effects of inorganic soil nutrient levels on tolerance to {AMD}, and different plants have shown different relationships between these variables. To assign some order to these disparate patterns and to resolve conflicts among the models, the ‘limiting resources model’ {(LRM)} was developed. However, we believe that the {LRM} is actually comprised of several different models, which we describe. Our study marks the first comprehensive and simultaneous test of the entire {LRM} framework, treating it explicitly as separate models, which also evaluates the models’ underlying assumptions. We studied tolerance to {AMD} in laboratory-reared natural populations of Arabidopsis thaliana from three different regions of Europe, spanning a wide latitudinal gradient. We show that, in different populations of this species, basic responses to nutrients and damage are best described by different models, which are based on different assumptions and make different predictions. This demonstrates the need for complexity in our explanations, and suggests that no one existing model can account for all relationships between tolerance to {AMD} and nutrients. Our results also demonstrate that fruit production can provide a misleading approximation of fitness in A. thaliana, contrary to the common assumption in the literature.},

Nonnormal data such as counts or proportions often defy classical statistical procedures. Generalized linear mixed models {(GLMMs)} provide a more flexible approach for analyzing nonnormal data when random effects are present. The explosion of research on {GLMMs} in the last decade has generated considerable uncertainty for practitioners in ecology and evolution. Despite the availability of accurate techniques for estimating {GLMM} parameters in simple cases, complex {GLMMs} are challenging to fit and statistical inference such as hypothesis testing remains difficult. We review the use (and misuse) of {GLMMs} in ecology and evolution, discuss estimation and inference and summarize [`]best-practice' data analysis procedures for scientists facing this challenge.},

Models},

	url = {http://www.bepress.com/jhubiostat/paper202/},
	abstract = {In linear mixed models, model selection frequently includes the selection of random effects. Two versions of the Akaike information criterion {(AIC)} have been
used, based either on the marginal or on the conditional distribution. We show that the marginal {AIC} is no longer an asymptotically unbiased estimator of the Akaike information, and in fact favours smaller models without random effects. For the conditional {AIC,} we show that ignoring estimation uncertainty in the random effects covariance matrix, as is common practice, induces a bias that leads to the
selection of any random effect not predicted to be exactly zero. We derive an analytic representation of a corrected version of the conditional {AIC,} which avoids
the high computational cost and imprecision of available numerical approximations.
An implementation in an R package is provided. All theoretical results are
illustrated in simulation studies, and their impact in practice is investigated in an
analysis of childhood malnutrition in Zambia.},

	abstract = {Many model search strategies involve trading off model fit with model complexity in a penalized goodness of fit measure. Asymptotic properties for these types of procedures in settings like linear regression and {ARMA} time series have been studied, but these do not naturally extend to nonstandard situations such as mixed effects models, where simple definition of the sample size is not meaningful. This paper introduces a new class of strategies, known as fence methods, for mixed model selection, which includes linear and generalized linear mixed models. The idea involves a procedure to isolate a subgroup of what are known as correct models (of which the optimal model is a member). This is accomplished by constructing a statistical fence, or barrier, to carefully eliminate incorrect models. Once the fence is constructed, the optimal model is selected from among those within the fence according to a criterion which can be made flexible. In addition, we propose two variations of the fence. The first is a stepwise procedure to handle situations of many predictors; the second is an adaptive approach for choosing a tuning constant. We give sufficient conditions for consistency of fence and its variations, a desirable property for a good model selection procedure. The methods are illustrated through simulation studies and real data analysis.},
