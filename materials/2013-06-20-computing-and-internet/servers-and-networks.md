## Synthesis and Collaboration 

> * Facilitated by computing and networking

## Or goal is to:

> * Provide basic background on computer networking to lay groundwork for later work on collaboration techniques that use the Internet


# Basic Client Server networking

> * Host computers connect via networking equipment
* Can send messages to each other over communication protocols
* Client: the host *initiating* the request
* Server: the host *responding* to a request

> * 80 routers at the core
* dense "mantle" of routers at the periphery
    - loss of the core still leaves > 70% of internet connected peer-to-peer
